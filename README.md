## Goals
Our goal with this project is to create a well defined linear algebra library. We've chosen to work on this because currently there aren't ones as functional as Pythons numpy.linalg.

## Timeline and Overveiw

- Checkpoint 1
  ~~- Vector Addition, dot product, magnitude~~
  ~~- Matrix addition, multiplication~~

- Checkpoint 2
   ~~- Transposition~~
  ~~- Determinants~~
  ~~- Inverses~~
  ~~- Special matrices.~~
  ~~- Decompositions~~
  ~~- Eigenproblems~~

- End
   ~~- Solvers~~
  ~~- Norms~~
  - Tensor
  - Statistical methods
  - Sparse matrix
  ~~- Kroeneker Product~~
  - Advanced Algorithms
  - Optimization problems

## Challenges:

One challenge will be learning Linear Algebra, since some of us in the group don't know some of the advanced linear algebra topics. Another challenge might be utilizing a new parallel processing library.
